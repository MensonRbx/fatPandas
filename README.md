# Pandas++
Python data analytics module based on pandas. Utilizes ChatGPT to come up with unique plots by sending it information about a pandas DataFrame and returns code to run to plot graphs.

# Current Roadmap:

1: Get basic functionality working as a proof of concept. 
2: Create methods of handling AI generated code to avoid errors and making GPT redo failed commands. (Currently here!).
3: Distribute as a webapp so it can be accessed by anyone.
